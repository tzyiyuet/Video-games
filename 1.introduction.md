# 1. Introduction
The recent development of the gaming industry is a glorious success. With the development, the tastes and preferences of gamers are changing over time. Free-to-play video games is one of the outcomes of the development as a distinct category compared to traditional video games. Traditionally, video games require payments from players before they can start playing. In contrast, free-to-play video games do not require any payments for entry, but instead, games can have options to purchase or not in-game services. After the first free-to-play video games released in 19991, free-to-play video games are growing fast and have captured a significant portion of the video game market. The massive growth comes to questions: which are better: free games or paid games? How are they different, excluding the payment methods?

To answers the questions, the report focuses on the data from Steam, which the dataset is from Kaggle2. Steam is a popular computer video game digital distribution service, which can be considered as an online computer games store. Up until December 2019, Steam has more than 30,000 video games3 and approximately 90 million monthly active users4. The large number of games on Steam can not only reflect the performances of these two categories of games on the specific distribution platform but also provide some insights into the general computer video games market. 

**The goal of the report is to examine the differences on what criterias define a good free game and a good paid game by comparing their models based on the given dataset. The hypothesis of the report is: in general, paid games are better than free games in terms of scores from gamers on Steam.** The intuition behind is as traditional games are paid games, most of the observed games with high scores are paid games. Notably, the top 25 trending games nowadays3 are mostly paid games.

In the following sections, the report will discuss the data description, models presentation, the results of comparisons, the conclusion and limitations based on the dataset and the models.
