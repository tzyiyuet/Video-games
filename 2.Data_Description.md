# 2. Data Description
The original dataset contains 27,059 observations and 18 variables. The variables of appid and name are excluded from the analysis since they are the identifiers of data. The variable of steamspy_tags is excluded as well since it is similar to the variables categories and genres. Moreover, the variable english is excluded because almost 99% of the games on Steam include English as the game language; the variable platform is excluded because all the games in the dataset can be run on Windows system; the variable of required_age is excluded because almost 99% of the games on Steam have no age requirements. In order to have significant insights on the score, observations with 0 average playtime are removed. Hence, the dataset is cleaned with 6,170 observations. After that, for comparison purposes, the dataset is separated into two: free games (price is equal to zero) dataset with 822 observations and paid games (price is not equal to zero) dataset with 5,348 observations.

## I. Variable: release_date
The release year of games is extracted from the variable release_date as a new variable. Both free games and paid games have a similar distribution in terms of their release year (Figure 1, as red being paid games and blue being free games). However, the amount of paid games drops significantly in 2018, while the drop is lighter for free games. The data is collected until April 2019, so the data in 2019 is incomplete, resulting in a low amount of games in 2019.

## II. Variable: developer
This variable indicates the developer of a game. Given the fact that there are many distinct developers, a new binary variable top developers is created in both datasets. Unlike paid games, the top developers of free games are not many. By examining the frequency of free games developers, and evaluating the scores of the related games, only four developers are considered as the top for free games. In contrast, top developers of paid games can be determined through https://steam250.com/developer. Hence, there are ten developers considered as the top for paid games. 

## III. Variable: publisher
This variable indicates the publisher of the game. Again, a new binary variable top publishers is created in both datasets by using the same method to create the variable top developers.

## IV. Variable: categories
This variable indicates the play mode of a game, which can be mainly categorized into two: single-player mode and multi-player mode. Given the fact that some games only have single-player mode, but others have both, a binary variable categories_dummy is created to determine whether a game has the multi-player mode. The result from Table 1 indicates that more than half of the free games contain multi-player mode, while only 22.85% of the paid games contain multi-player mode.

## V. Variable: genres
This variable indicates the genre of a game, which can be mainly categorized into ten common genres: action, adventure, casual, indie, massively multiplayer, RPG, racing, simulation, sports and strategy. Hence, ten binary variables are created for each genre. As Table 2 shows, both datasets have a similar distribution in terms of genres as indie games are the most common genre, while racing and sports games are the most uncommon genres. The main differences are paid games have a higher portion on adventure games, and free games have a higher portion on massively multiplayer games.

## VI. Variable: achievements
This variable indicates the in-game achievement that a game has if there are any. The mean value of achievements on free games (31.76) is lower than the mean value of achievements on paid games (48.95). Additionally, the max value of achievements (1,559) of free games is much lower than paid gamesâ€™ (5,000).

## VII. Variable: positive_ratings and negative_ratings
These variables indicate the number of positive and negative ratings that a game receives. The two variables are used to create the new variable score in both datasets. The calculation used is from SteamDB (https://steamdb.info/blog/steamdb-rating/), which generates a relative fair value of the score on a game. Thus, the variable score is created as the dependent variable. In particular, the mean score of free games is 67.36, and the median is 68.80, while the mean score of paid games is 67.98, and the median is 71.58, which is relatively equal. Also, as Figure 2 shows, a number of outliers are in the dataset of paid games.

## VIII. Variable: average_playtime
This variable indicates the average playtime in hours of a game. In both datasets, the average playtime is extremely right-skewed, revealing that most gamers spend 1 (since games with 0 hour of playtime are not considered in the analysis) to 5,000 hours on average on a game. Mainly, the mean average playtime of free games is 1,442.35 hours, while the mean average playtime of paid games is 536.7 hours.

## IX. Variable: median_playtime
This variable indicates the median playtime in hours of a game. Again, in both datasets, the median playtime is right-skewed. The mean median playtime of free games is 1,337.9 hours, while the mean median playtime of paid games is 533.8 hours.

## X. Variable: owners
This variable indicates the estimation of owners on a game. The variable is a range of owner size including the lower and upper bound. A new variable owners_size is created in both dataset as a numeric variable indicates the size of each group. There are 13 groups in total, so the new variable includes index numbers from 1 to 13 (Table 3).

Table 3: Index Number Table of the Owner Size

A bigger number demonstrates a larger size of owners with 1 as the smallest group (0-20,000) and 13 as the largest size (100,000,000-200,000,000) The distribution of owner size is quite different from each other. For free games, group 5 (200,000-500,000) is the largest group and is much larger than the other groups (Figure 3). For paid games, group 2 (20,000-50,000), group 4 (100,000-200,000) as well as group 5 (200,000-500,000) are approximately equally large. (Figure 4).
