# 2. Data Description
The original dataset contains 27,059 observations and 18 variables. The variables of appid and name are excluded from the analysis since they are the identifiers of data. The variable of steamspy_tags is excluded as well since it is similar to the variables categories and genres. Moreover, the variable english is excluded because almost 99% of the games on Steam include English as the game language; the variable platform is excluded because all the games in the dataset can be run on Windows system; the variable of required_age is excluded because almost 99% of the games on Steam have no age requirements. In order to have significant insights on the score, observations with 0 average playtime are removed. Hence, the dataset is cleaned with 6,170 observations. After that, for comparison purposes, the dataset is separated into two: free games (price is equal to zero) dataset with 822 observations and paid games (price is not equal to zero) dataset with 5,348 observations.

# I. Variable: release_date
The release year of games is extracted from the variable release_date as a new variable. Both free games and paid games have a similar distribution in terms of their release year (Appendix 1 and 2). However, the amount of paid games drops significantly in 2018, while the drop is lighter for free games. The data is collected until April 2019, so the data in 2019 is incomplete, resulting in a low amount of games in 2019.
# II. Variable: developer
This variable indicates the developer of a game. Given the fact that there are many distinct developers, a new binary variable top developers is created in both datasets. Unlike paid games, the top developers of free games are not many. By examining the frequency of free games developers, and evaluating the scores of the related games, only four developers are considered as the top for free games. In contrast, top developers of paid games can be determined through https://steam250.com/developer. Hence, there are ten developers considered as the top for paid games. 
# III. Variable: publisher
This variable indicates the publisher of the game. Again, a new binary variable top publishers is created in both datasets by using the same method to create the variable top developers.
# IV. Variable: categories
This variable indicates the play mode of a game, which can be mainly categorized into two: single-player mode and multi-player mode. Given the fact that some games only have single-player mode, but others have both, a binary variable categories_dummy is created to determine whether a game has the multi-player mode. The result from Figure 1 indicates that more than half of the free games contain multi-player mode, while only 22.85% of the paid games contain multi-player mode.
