## 3. Models Presentation
Four models will be analyzed in this section, which two are based on the free games dataset, the others are based on the paid games dataset. From the previous section, some collinear variables are found from PCA. These variables will be excluded from building the models in both datasets: median playtime and top publishers.

# I. Models: Free games
The model is built by using the method of boosting for the purpose of building a low MSE model. Based on the variable analysis in the previous section, the independent variables include achievements, average playtime, multi-player game mode, genre action, genre adventure, genre casual, genre indie, genre massively multi-player, genre RPG, genre racing, genre simulation, genre sports, genre strategy, release year, owner size and top developers. The dependent variable is the score of a game. However, the first boosting model indicates that there are two variables that are not significant, and they are removed to build a more accurate model.

The final model contains 14 variables (Figure 10) compared to the 16 at the beginning, which are (order in the level of significance): average playtime, achievements, owner size, release year, multi-player game mode, genre indie, genre action, genre massively multi-player, genre casual, genre adventure, genre simulation, genre strategy, genre RPG and genre sports.

The model has 10,000 trees and each tree has 6 internal nodes, resulting in an MSE of 0.3217.

To understand the correlations between the dependent variable and each independent variable, a PCA plot analysis as Figure 11 is performed again.

Correlations are described in Table 4:
| Correlations with Scores | Variables |
|--------------------------|-----------|
| Positive | genre simulation, genre casual, genre indie, genre adventure, average playtime, owner size |
| Negative | genre action, achievements, multi-player mode, genre massively multi-player, genre RPG, genre strategy, release year |
