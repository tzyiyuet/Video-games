## 3. Models Presentation
Four models will be analyzed in this section, which two are based on the free games dataset, the others are based on the paid games dataset. From the previous section, some collinear variables are found from PCA. These variables will be excluded from building the models in both datasets: median playtime and top publishers.

# I. Models: Free games
The model is built by using the method of boosting for the purpose of building a low MSE model. Based on the variable analysis in the previous section, the independent variables include achievements, average playtime, multi-player game mode, genre action, genre adventure, genre casual, genre indie, genre massively multi-player, genre RPG, genre racing, genre simulation, genre sports, genre strategy, release year, owner size and top developers. The dependent variable is the score of a game. However, the first boosting model indicates that there are two variables that are not significant, and they are removed to build a more accurate model.

The final model contains 14 variables (Figure 10) compared to the 16 at the beginning, which are (order in the level of significance): average playtime, achievements, owner size, release year, multi-player game mode, genre indie, genre action, genre massively multi-player, genre casual, genre adventure, genre simulation, genre strategy, genre RPG and genre sports.

The model has 10,000 trees and each tree has 6 internal nodes, resulting in an MSE of 0.3217.

To understand the correlations between the dependent variable and each independent variable, a PCA plot analysis as Figure 11 is performed again.

Correlations are described in Table 4:
| Correlations with Scores | Variables |
|--------------------------|-----------|
| Positive | genre simulation, genre casual, genre indie, genre adventure, average playtime, owner size |
| Negative | genre action, achievements, multi-player mode, genre massively multi-player, genre RPG, genre strategy, release year |

Given the fact that the boosting model can only provide limited rationales behind the model, a regression tree model (Figure 12) is built by only containing the four most significant variables from the boosting model to understand further how these variables influence the score of a free game. Based on the regression tree model, free games with the owner size that is smaller than 200,000 or smaller than 500,000 and are released between 2012 and 2016 have relatively low scores. Also, free games that are released after 2014 tend to have higher scores.

## II. Models: Paid games
Again, the same method is used for the paid games dataset. The independent variables include achievements, average playtime, price, multi-player game mode, genre action, genre adventure, genre casual, genre indie, genre massively multi-player, genre RPG, genre racing, genre simulation, genre sports, genre strategy, release year, owner size and top developers. The dependent variable is the score of the game. The first boosting model indicates that there are three insignificant variables so they are removed after. 

The final model contains 13 variables (Figure 13) compared to the 17 at the beginning, which are (order in the level of significance): average playtime, price, achievements, release year, owner size, genre action, genre adventure, genre casual, genre indie, multi-player mode, genre simulation, genre strategy and genre RPG.

Figure 13: Rank of variables’ significance from the boosting paid game model

The model has 280,000 trees, and each tree has 8 internal nodes, resulting in an MSE of 0.4803.
Again, to further understand the correlations between the dependent variable and each independent variable, a PCA plot analysis (Figure 14) is performed again.

Figure 14: PCA Plot of Paid Games Model

Correlations are described in Table 5:
| Correlations with Scores | Variables |
|--------------------------|-----------|
| Positive | owner size, genre RPG, price, multi-player mode, average playtime, genre strategy, genre action |
| Negative | genre simulation, achievements, genre casual, release year, genre indie, genre adventure |

Again, a regression tree model is built by using the five most significant independent variables. According to Figure 15, paid games with low prices, low number of in-game achievements and is released after 2013 have low scores. In addition, paid games with low prices, more than six in-game achievements, and owner size smaller than 500,000 also have relatively low scores. Nevertheless, paid games that are priced more than 5.3 pounds tend to have higher scores.
