## 4. Results from Comparisons
By simply comparing to the mean score (free: 67.98 vs. paid: 67.36) and the (free: 68.80 vs. paid: 71.58) median score, the score of paid games is slightly better than free games’. Therefore, the hypothesis of the report that paid games is better than paid games in terms of the game score is accepted. However, the gap is small, and there are more outliers as paid games in the paid games dataset with immensely low scores than free games’, which also forms a bigger score range of paid games, with the minimum score of 0 and the maximum score of 97.26. 

Regards to the distinctions and similarities between two categories of games, some findings from the models are summarized in Figure 16.

Figure 16: Comparison on Models' Result

The findings are summarized by the following:
* the most significant variables for high score free games and paid games is the average playtime;
* both free games and paid games with large owner size tend to have high scores;
* as time goes, the scores of both types of games decrease;
*	high number of in-game achievements make a game receive a lower score, an optimal number of in-game achievements need to be identified for a specific game;
*	multi-player mode works good in paid games but not in free games;
*	games contain the genres of indie, casual, adventure or simulation as free games are more likely to receive high scores; which are opposite for paid games;
*	games contain the genres of RPG and strategy as paid games are more likely to receive high scores, which are opposite for free games;
*	high price paid games tend to have a higher score, but it is not a consideration for free games;
*	the genre of a game is not the most significant factor for a high score game;
*	an unreleased free game is a single-player indie, casual, adventure or simulation game may have a high score; 
*	an unreleased paid game is a multi-player high priced action, strategy or RPG game may have a high score.
