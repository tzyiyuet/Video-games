## 5. Conclusion & Limitations
While free games do not require entry payment from gamers, which welcome everyone to try them out, paid games ensure a more guaranteed gaming experience, which requires a stable source of income from gamers for maintenance (entry payment). Based on the characteristics of free PC games, most of them do not have high requirements for systems. Hence, this kind of systems are more suitable for small games such as indie games, casual games, adventure games and simulation games, especially for indie games, which are developed by a handful of developers. Gamers have low threshold to try regards to economic resources, and they are likely to rate loosely. On the other hand, good RPG and strategy games usually contain abundant game content and plots. And good action games may have higher requirements on systems so that the games can have more appealing fights. Thus, these genres of games can perform better as paid PC games for a higher level of rendering. Moreover, as gamers have paid, they may expect to receive the corresponding quality of gaming experience and rate accordingly. In terms of multi-player mode, most of the paid games do not have in-game purchases, so multi-player mode simply serves as a bounus or a selling point for gamers. At the same time, paid games tend to have more stable servers to support group play compared to free games that do not have a stable income as paid games. Additionally, unlike paid games, in-game purchase leads to a psychological gap between gamers in free games’ multi-player mode. That is, gamers who do not have in-game purchases may not have the gaming experience as good as those have the purchases, which may lead to gamers writing negative ratings. 

All in all, free games and paid games are under different business models and target distinct segmentations. Through the analysis, it demonstrates that certain genres of games tend to perform better as free games or as paid games. Since free games become more and more popular, it is worth to examine how this kind of game can better cater to gamers’ preferences; and, meanwhile, continue to extend the advantages of paid games. By doing so, a diverse gaming market can be provided for gamers with more choices.

There are some limitations of the models. First, some potential factors are not collected in the dataset, such as the graphic quality of games, various distinctive in-game systems, the quality of user interfaces, the quality of customer service of games, the revenue of games, et cetera. As gamers have stricter and stricter demand on gaming, these variables may also be significant to distinguish free games and paid games. For instance, the graphic quality of free games may be lower than paid games’, and leads to different perspectives on ratings. 
Second, the score system is unperfect. According to the calculation from SteamDB, ratings are biased toward 50%. The ratings of games with a small owner size usually have less positive or negative ratings. Hence, games with fewer total ratings are biased heavily as the sample size is small. Moreover, small owner size (0-20,000) occupies a certain portion in both datasets, especially for paid games, resulting in less subjective scores for games with small owner size. 
Third, the boosting model of paid games may have the potential to be overfitting because the number of trees is substantial, and meanwhile, the number of interaction nodes are larger than the Salford Default Setting (6 nodes). Furthermore, some significant variables, such as the average playtime and achievements, are excessively skewed, which may be noisy data for the boosting model.
